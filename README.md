# 🧑‍💻 Atharva Patel — CSE Student Repository

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository!

I'm Atharva Patel, currently pursuing my **Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)**. This repository serves as a collection of everything I explore, build, and learn during my first year of engineering.

## 📚 Purpose of This Repo

This repo is a central hub for:

- 📝 **Notes**: Key concepts and summaries from subjects and tutorials  
- 💻 **Code**: Assignments, practice problems, and small projects  
- 🧪 **Experiments**: Trial-and-error code, learning new tools or languages  
- ⚙️ **Setup files**: Configs or dotfiles that help me with development  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

I'm gradually learning and using:

- **Languages**: C++, Python, Shell
- **Concepts**: Programming fundamentals, Data Structures, OOP
- **Tools**: Git & GitHub, VSCode, Linux, Qt/QML (for GUI)

> Everything here reflects my growth as a student — it's a work in progress, always evolving.


## ✅ Focus Areas (Year 1)

- Understand programming and problem solving using C++  
- Learn version control with Git and GitHub  
- Explore Linux as a development environment  
- Start building small, meaningful projects
