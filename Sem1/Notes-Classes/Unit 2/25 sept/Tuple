# tuple ()

ordered 
immutable

characteristics
1 tuple can have one or more elements
2 it can store homogeneous and heterogeneous elements
3 Indexing is supported :
                        zero indexing        0 -> len-1
                        negative indexing   -1 -> -len


4 Nested tuple is supported
5 Tuples are iterable 
6 Duplicated are allowed in tuple
7 immutable --once created cant be changed
8 supports slicing
9 Packing and Unpacking is supported 
10 Single element in tuple needs comma
   eg (10)   -> int
      (10 ,) -> tuple
11 Swap (a,b=b,a)
12 returning multiple values from a function , by default it returns as a tuple
13 dir(tuple) -> gives built in function



Application :
             1 Dictionary keys(hash)
             2 Represent any fixed coordinates : RGB coordinate




Features :
            List:
                 List is mutable 
                 Syntax []
                 Performance : Slower than tuple
                 dynamic -- values can be changed

            Tuple:
                 Tuple is immutable
                 Syntax ()
                 Performance faster
                 static





Empty Tuple:
a=()
or 
a=tuple() --constructor   


t1=(0)   --> <class int>
t1=(0,)  --> <class tuple>



# Tuple can have other objects in tuples : 
          (0, [2,5,8], (1,2,3))



# Can be accessed through index   
 changing through index ---gives type error 
   but but but ..
   a=(1,3,4,[4,5,6],(1,3,6))
     -- if i change the list item inside tuple it can be changed ... not only list but any mutable objects        


# Elements cant be changed once created

# assignment of one tuple to another caused refrence to the same tuple :
t1=(1,2,3)
t2=t1

here t2 will refere to te only -- deep copy

.copy() not valid instead use t2=tuple(t1)



# Methods
 len()
 sum()
 max()
 min()
 sorted() --> sorted will be list so after that we can convert it back to tuple
 sorted(t1,reverse=True)
 index()
 count()
 type()
 id()

 # Pack and Unpack --read about it


 # any() --returns true if any of the elements of the iterable(list,tuple,dict) are true
