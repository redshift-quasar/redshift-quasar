Tuple ()

ordered 
immutable

characteristics
1 tuple can have one or more elements
2 it can store homogeneous and heterogeneous elements
3 Indexing is supported :
                        zero indexing        0 -> len-1
                        negative indexing   -1 -> -len


4 Nested tuple is supported
5 Tuples are iterable 
6 Duplicated are allowed in tuple
7 immutable --once created cant be changed
8 supports slicing
9 Packing and Unpacking is supported 
10 Single element in tuple needs coma
   eg (10)   -> int
      (10 ,) -> tuple
11 Swap (a,b=b,a)
12 returning multiple values from a function , by default it returns as a tuple
13 dir(tuple) -> gives built in function



Application :
             1 Dictionary keys(hash)
             2 Represent any fixed coordinates : RGB coordinate




Features :
            List:
                 List is mutable 
                 Syntax []
                 Performance : Slower than tuple
                 dynamic -- values can be changed

            Tuple:
                 Tuple is immutable
                 Syntax ()
                 Performance faster
                 static





Empty Tuple:
a=()
or 
a=tuple() --constructor   


t1=(0)   --> <class int>
t1=(0,)  --> <class tuple>



#Tuple can have other objects in tuples : 
          (0, [2,5,8], (1,2,3))



# Can be accessed through index
