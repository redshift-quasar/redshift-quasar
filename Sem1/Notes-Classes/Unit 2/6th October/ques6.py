str1="""Betty bought some butter,
But she said the butterâ€™s bitter,
If I put it in my batter,
It will make my batter bitter,
But a bit of better butter,
That would make my batter better.

So Betty bought a bit of better butter,
And put it in her batter,
And the batter was not bitter,
So it was better Betty bought a bit of better butter."""
